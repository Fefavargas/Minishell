when parsing redirection, for << (heredoc) we need to store the delimiter. we could store this in the "file" in the struct ?

Also, heredocs always need to be done first in case of multiple redirections
e.g. 
cat > output.txt << EOF
Hello, World!
EOF
In this case, you would need to do the parsing so that the first node contains redirection: <<, file: EOF (delimiter), str "Hello, World!\n"


another thought - what should be max line length for heredoc








- If we have echo + multiple args, how do we put this into the struct - should there be an array of strings?
- still need to figure out echo -n
