NEW: when parsing redirection, for << (heredoc) we need to store the delimiter. we could store this in the "file" in the struct ?



- If we have echo + multiple args, how do we put this into the struct - should there be an array of strings?
- still need to figure out echo -n

 - we should parse a local envp for environment variables - in the main i make a local envp and pass it to the shell. or we can add it to the structure?
