Janae-  28th Nov:
i need the parser to provide in the struct both input_fd and output_fd (First and last)



janae - 23rd nov:

when parsing redirection, for << (heredoc) we need to store the delimiter. we could store this in the "file" in the struct ?

Also, heredocs always need to be done first in case of multiple redirections
e.g. 
cat > output.txt << EOF
Hello, World!
EOF
In this case, you would need to do the parsing so that the first node contains redirection: <<, file: EOF (delimiter), str "Hello, World!\n"













note to self (janae): how to avoid break's / returns exiting the whole programme, it should just "break" within minishell...


- If we have echo + multiple args, how do we put this into the struct - should there be an array of strings?
- still need to figure out echo -n
